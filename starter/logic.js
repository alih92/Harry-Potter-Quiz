/*Harry Potter quiz pseudocode
Which elements of the HTML do I need to target? Need to have these in variables to be able to reference and manipulate later on

1. Quiz starts only when user clicks on the start button -> need an eventlistener for this with a function being called to display the questions
  a. once the button is clicked, it, and any other text, disappears. How can i do this? hide? 
2. Question title and choices need to show up after the start button is clicked and disappears. -> can this be a function to dislay the questions?
  a. Iterate through the questions and get the text to show up -> use .textContent?
    -> how can i keep a track of the questions index? 
  b. Display the choices using .textContent ->choices is an array so maybe another for loop? use .textContent to display again. 
3. set a timer -> set it to count down from , e.g. 100 - maybe use count--;
  a. impelement a penalty of 10 seconds for each wrong answer - how can I do this? maybe some sort of decrementing option?
  b.
